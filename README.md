## ðŸŒŒ the lore

it all started when i thought "hey, what if computers could think?" and now i'm here, making large language models spill their therapy sessions through gradient analysis (yes, that's actually my research lmao). somewhere between debugging pytorch and living on huggingface, i developed an emotional attachment to neural networks.
