well. if you are here, do drop me a mail (bythyag at gmail dot com) if you want to talk about intesting ongoing ai projects, research, or talk about your favourite book. 

i am ai engineering with a formal degree in production engineering. i like to build interesting generative ai projects, work on scalability, write technical blogs, and love to play old songs at 1am. rest assured, i am a human and not an agi.

what i am doing these days: 
- revising and rebuilding my computer science and machine learning fundamentals.
- catching up with readings on my bookshelf.
