```python
# brain.py
status = "ABSOLUTELY CRACKED AT ML"
coffee_consumed = float('inf')
bugs_squashed = "too many to count"
current_state = "living in the matrix"
```

## 🚀 WHAT I'M COOKING RN

- 🧠 Making LLMs spill their psychological secrets (fr fr)
- 🏗️ Teaching AI to run entire factory floors (no cap)
- 🤖 Building army of AI agents (they're kinda my besties now)
- 📚 Created some INSANE Q&A systems that actually work???

## 💻 THE TOOLS I ABUSE DAILY

- PyTorch (we're in a committed relationship)
- HuggingFace (my second home fr)
- LangChain + OpenAI (the dynamic duo)
- Pandas + NumPy (the OGs)

## 🎮 SIDE QUESTS

- Graduated from print("hello world") to training neural nets
- Turning caffeine into AGI
- My rubber duck debugger is my therapist
- Probably arguing with ChatGPT about the meaning of life

## 🌟 CURRENT ACHIEVEMENTS UNLOCKED

- Made BERT tell me its deepest feelings (real psychology hours)
- Got robots to make smart decisions (they're learning fr fr)
- Built some absolutely CRACKED data analysis agents
- Didn't break production (yet)
