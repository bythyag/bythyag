🪷 if you’re here, don’t forget to say hi. feel free to drop me a mail: bythyag at gmail dot com

i’m an ai engineer with a background in production and industrial engineering from iit delhi. i like train small llms, building generative ai projects, digging into concepts, and often stress over whether i truly understand things deeply enough. i also write blogs on bear. sometimes, you’ll catch me playing old songs at 1am with stuffs like “ruk ja chand, theher ja re chanda” and a tab on "jupiter retrograde." 

don’t worry, i’m definitely human. not an agi, for now?
