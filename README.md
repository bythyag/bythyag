🪷 if you’re here, don’t forget to say hi. feel free to drop me a mail: bythyag at gmail dot com

i’m an ai engineer with a background in production and industrial engineering from iit delhi. i like building generative ai projects, digging into core concepts, and often stress over whether i truly understand things deeply enough. i also write blogs on bear. sometimes, you’ll catch me playing old songs at 1am—stuff like “ruk ja chand, theher ja re chanda.”

don’t worry, i’m definitely human. not an agi.
