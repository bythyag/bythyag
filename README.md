üçì if you're here, don't forget to say hi! feel free to drop me a mail: bythyag at gmail dot com

i'm an ai engineer with a formal degree in production and industrial engineering from iit delhi. i enjoy building generative ai projects, get into conceptual depth, and get anxious about my understanding not being deep enough. i also write blogs at bear. ocassianlly i play old songs at 1am which sounds like "ruk ja chand, teher ja re chanda". 

rest assured, i'm a human, not an agi. my best flex is i do lip reading, and decide best foods at cafe.
