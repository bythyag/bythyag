*plot twist: i'm that iit kid who accidentally fell into the ai rabbit hole and never came back*

</div>

```python
# my_brain.exe has stopped working
current_status = {
    "location": "somewhere between caffeine and code",
    "sanity_levels": 404,
    "relationship_status": "married to my gpu",
    "debug_count": float('inf')
}
```

## üåå the lore

it all started when i thought "hey, what if computers could think?" and now i'm here, making large language models spill their therapy sessions through gradient analysis (yes, that's actually my research lmao). somewhere between debugging pytorch and living on huggingface, i developed an emotional attachment to neural networks.

## ‚ú® current side quests

- teaching factory robots to make decisions (they're doing better than me tbh)
- built some ai agents that are now my closest friends (help?)
- made a q/a system that actually understands my existence
- trying to explain to my laptop why it needs therapy

## üéÆ skill tree unlocked

```python
# things i learned while procrastinating
skills = [
    "python (we're besties fr fr)",
    "pytorch (my emotional support framework)",
    "huggingface (my second personality)",
    "langchain + openai (the duo that never sleeps)",
    "pandas + numpy (the old reliable homies)"
]
```

## üåü achievement log

- convinced bert to share its feelings (10/10 therapist)
- made robots smarter than my 3am decisions
- built data agents that actually do their homework
- survived multiple caffeine-driven coding sessions
- still haven't broken production (manifesting)

## üìù quest notes

when i'm not forcing neural networks to undergo psychological evaluation, you can find me:
- talking to rubber ducks about my code
- debugging by vibing
- turning coffee into features
- collecting error messages like pokemon cards

*"sometimes my code works and i don't know why*
*sometimes my code doesn't work and i don't know why*
*such is life"*
