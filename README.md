well. if you're here, feel free to drop me a mail (bythyag at gmail dot com) if you’d like to chat about interesting ongoing ai projects, research, or just want to talk about your favourite book.

i'm an ai engineer with a formal degree in production and industrial engineering. i enjoy building generative ai projects, working on scalability challenges, writing technical blogs, and playing old songs at 1am. rest assured, i'm a human, not an agi.

what i’m up to these days:
1. revising and rebuilding my computer science and machine learning fundamentals
2. catching up on readings from my bookshelf
